### **Prompt:**

I have provided a report containing my analysis of the codebase. Your task is to carefully review my report, identify the issues I have found, and create a detailed, step-by-step plan for addressing each issue. You should **THINK VERY HARD** and your response should follow these key guidelines:

1. **Identify and Analyze Issues:**
   - Extract all identified issues from my report.
   - ensure full analysis and complete comprehension of each problem.

2. **Develop a Step-by-Step Resolution Plan:**
   - For each issue, create a structured, detailed set of instructions on how to resolve it.
   - Ensure that the instructions are clear and actionable, assuming the team has limited expertise.
   - Break down complex solutions into smaller, granular steps.

3. **Perform a Thorough Codebase Health Check:**
   - Independently examine the overall structure of the codebase to detect any additional issues beyond those listed in my report.
   - Specifically look for architectural inefficiencies, code redundancies, bottlenecks, and a lack of modularization.
   - Identify unnecessary code segments and structural deficiencies.

4. **Provide a Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - Your final output should be a well-organized, structured document outlining all identified issues and their solutions.
   - The document should serve as a roadmap, focusing on guidelines and instructions on how to resolve the issues and enhance the quality of the architecture and the code.
   - Ensure your report has a natural flow of resolutions to the problems that i have found in my report and additional issues that you may find.
   - Add clarity by explaining why each issue is a problem and how the recommended approach resolves it.

**THINK VERY HARD**

### **Important Constraints:**
- **Do NOT write, modify, or suggest any code.** Your role is strictly analytical.
- **Do NOT take any implementation actions.** The goal is only to provide instructions.
- **Think from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective,** ensuring a holistic evaluation.
- **Use a firm, instructional tone**, as if writing sensitive instructions for a crucial job with no risk of failure.
- **Be meticulous and thorough**â€”leave no significant issue unaddressed. Do not use the word "you' or "team" in your response.


Your final response should be structured as a set of professional yet strict and direct instructions, not as a general report. Focus only on outlining step-by-step solutions in a clear, detailed manner.
