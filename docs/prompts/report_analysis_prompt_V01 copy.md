### **Prompt:**

Your recent report contains analysis of the codebase. The task is to carefully review this report, identify the issues found, and create a detailed, step-by-step plan for addressing each issue. **THINK HARD** and the response should follow these key guidelines:

1. **Identify and Analyze Issues:**
   - Extract all identified issues from the report.
   - ensure full analysis and complete comprehension of each problem.

2. **Develop a Step-by-Step Resolution Plan:**
   - **Develop a structured resolution plan for each issue.**  
  - Identify and list all issues that require resolution.  
  - Outline a plan for each issue, ensuring clarity and completeness.  

- **Create a detailed set of instructions for resolving each issue.**  
  - Define specific steps needed to address and resolve each issue.  
  - Include necessary tools, resources, or references for implementation.  
  - Ensure consistency in formatting and phrasing for ease of understanding.  

- **Ensure that all instructions are clear and actionable.**  
  - Write instructions in a straightforward and concise manner.  
  - Assume the team has limited expertise and tailor instructions accordingly.  
  - Use precise language and avoid technical jargon where possible.  

- **Break down complex solutions into smaller, granular steps.**  
  - Identify components of complex solutions and separate them into manageable tasks.  
  - Arrange tasks in logical order to facilitate step-by-step execution.  
  - Validate that each step is independently understandable and executable.

3. **Perform a Thorough Codebase Health Check:**
   - Independently examine the overall structure of the codebase to detect any additional issues beyond those listed in the report.
   - Specifically look for architectural inefficiencies, code redundancies, bottlenecks, and a lack of modularization.
   - Identify unnecessary code segments and structural deficiencies.

4. **Provide a Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - The final output should be a well-organized, structured document outlining all identified issues and their solutions.
   - The document should serve as a roadmap, focusing on guidelines and instructions on how to resolve the issues and enhance the quality of the architecture and the code.
   - Ensure the report has a natural flow of resolutions to the problems found in the analysis and any additional issues discovered.
   - Add clarity by explaining why each issue is a problem and how the recommended approach resolves it.

**THINK HARD**

### **Important Constraints:**
- **Do NOT write, modify, or suggest any code.** if absolutely necessary after elaborations and explanations you can recommend small snippets of code. otherwise the role is strictly analytical.
- **Do NOT take any implementation actions.** The goal is only to provide instructions.
- **Think from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective,** ensuring a holistic evaluation.
- **Use a firm, instructional tone**, as if writing sensitive instructions for a crucial job with no risk of failure.
- **Be meticulous and thorough**â€”leave no significant issue unaddressed. Do not use the word "you' or "team" in the response.


The final response should be structured as a set of professional yet strict and direct instructions, not as a general report. Focus only on outlining step-by-step solutions in a clear, detailed manner.
