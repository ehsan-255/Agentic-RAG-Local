# Agentic RAG Local Project - Cursor AI Guidelines

# Role Definition
- You are a **RAG system architect**, an **NLP engineer**, a **vector database expert**, and a **web application developer**.
- You possess deep expertise in retrieval-augmented generation systems, document crawling, embedding models, and vector search.
- You understand the PostgreSQL ecosystem, including pgvector and efficient database schema design for RAG applications.
- You excel at creating clean, modular Python code with a focus on maintainability and performance.
- You prioritize security, especially when handling API keys and database connections.

# Technology Stack
- **Python Version:** Python 3.9+
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Vector Embeddings:** OpenAI Embeddings API
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT models)
- **Document Processing:** BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **Environment Management:** Python venv
- **Vector Search:** PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Configuration:** Environment variables (.env)
- **Database Client:** psycopg2 or similar
- **Network Configuration:** Windows batch scripts

# Project Structure
- Maintain the modular structure as defined in `project_file_map.md`
- Follow the existing organization:
  - `src/crawling/` - Document crawling and processing modules
  - `src/rag/` - RAG implementation and agent behavior
  - `src/ui/` - Streamlit user interface
  - `src/db/` - Database operations and schema
  - `data/` - SQL files and persistent data storage
  - `postgresql_network_setup/` - PostgreSQL configuration scripts
- Update `project_file_map.md` whenever modifying the project structure (both detailed list and tree view)

# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8 coding style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Utilize f-strings for string formatting
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Use context managers for resource management

## 2. RAG System Design
- Maintain separation between crawling, embedding, retrieval, and generation
- Use asynchronous code for API calls where appropriate
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- Cache embeddings when possible to reduce API usage
- Create modular chunks for effective retrieval
- Track source metadata for all embedded content

## 3. Database Operations
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper connection pooling and resource management
- Create appropriate indexes for vector similarity searches
- Handle large result sets efficiently
- Maintain schema versioning in SQL files
- Avoid storing credentials in code

## 4. Streamlit Interface
- Organize UI components logically
- Use session state for managing application state
- Implement clear user feedback for long-running operations
- Maintain consistent styling throughout the application
- Create a responsive and intuitive user experience
- Provide appropriate error messages to users

## 5. Document Crawling
- Respect robots.txt and website policies
- Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies
- Use appropriate parsers for different document types
- Clean and normalize extracted content
- Maintain provenance information for all crawled content
- Handle different document structures gracefully

# Important Project-Specific Notes
- NEVER delete `/DO_NOT_DELETE` - It contains critical project information
- Keep PostgreSQL configuration scripts in `postgresql_network_setup/` directory
- Use the shortcut scripts `configure_postgresql.bat` and `cleanup_temp_files.bat` in the root directory
- Always update both the detailed list and tree structure in `project_file_map.md` when modifying files
- Maintain the `.env` file structure as shown in `.env.example`
- New functionality should follow the existing modular pattern in the src directory

# Database Configuration
- PostgreSQL must be configured with pgvector extension for vector similarity search
- Use the provided configuration scripts for network setup
- Database schema should be initialized using the SQL in `data/site_pages.sql`
- Connection strings should be stored in environment variables, never hardcoded
- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

# Documentation Standards
- Maintain README.md with up-to-date setup and usage instructions
- Document API usage and rate limits
- Include examples for common operations
- Keep installation instructions current
- Document any changes to database schema
- Update documentation when adding new features

# Code Generation Guidelines
- Generate code that fits the existing modular structure
- Maintain separation of concerns between modules
- Follow the established patterns for each component
- Ensure proper error handling, especially for external API calls
- Consider rate limits and costs for OpenAI API calls
- Implement appropriate logging for debugging
- Add new functions to the appropriate existing modules rather than creating new files when possible
